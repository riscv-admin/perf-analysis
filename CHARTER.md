# Performance Analysis SIG 

The RISC-V Performance Analysis SIG The perf-analysis SIG is formed to ensure the development of leading edge end-to-end solutions for profiling and optimizing software running on RISC-V processors.  The SIG will assess the state of the art for hardware monitoring capabilities as well as for profiling and visualization tools.  The SIG will further assess the state of RISC-V enabling for the existing performance monitoring ecosystem, including system software, profiling tools, and compilers.  The SIG will spawn and oversee TGs for any identified gaps.
